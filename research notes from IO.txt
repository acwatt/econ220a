Kaitlin Springel EV's and charging station:
- hedonic model of cars with "attributes" that include consumer's perception of availability and cost of charging stations



does gov't investment Crowd in vs crowd out private investment in space tech? How much crowding in?



==============================================================
      Meeting with Ben 2020
==============================================================

1. emerging market: what types of subsidies would start the market?
- subsidies on rockets (transportation)
- subsidies on space techonology (mining equipment, habitation)








2. mining / supply chain
- NASA has annouced that they want to support and spur an emerging space economy
- mining companies (fixed costs, market power, barriers to entry, market structure)
- assume water is the only mined resource
- plenty of customers in space that need water for radiation shielding, human habitation, fuel
- mining company does not own the rockets (hires a transportation company like spaceX)
- invests in R&D and mining equipment
- NASA has a


Optimal resource extraction
What are the things about the market that seem extremeley different from an IO point? Look at nearest markets, like oil or other mining, and list down what's different and what could be borrowed
- energy markets
- nuclear power (heavily support by the gov't at the beginning)

If there are large positive externalities ==> reasoning for heavy subsidies

Optimal resource extraction of an asteroid orbiting the moon under different property ownership regemes.
- the company owns the asterroid
- public ownership (free for all)
- leased plots

Need a model of water extraction (increasing marginal costs, like oil)
Extremely high fixed costs like nuclear

What does this look like under different market structures?
What if SpaceX vertically integrates a mining company? Then they are a monopoly in the transport & mining
- like if an electricity distributor (transport) also owned electricity generation
- like printers (offer cheaper transport to space, and marked up cost of fuel)
- people get more concern when a single entity that gets more and more control over something important: when one actor has complete control over the fuel sorce in space?
- property rights increase over time and early exploration might have a large positive externality. May want to incentivize early exploration, then decrease over time.
-- electric cars: build charging stations during building e- cars. -- what are the policies that incentivise the increase of the size

- is there current regulation preventing e- distributors from owning e- generation?

Double marginalization: two stacked monopolies markups








3. permitting pollution

cap & trade or subsidies:
- take CO2 cap & trade -- is there something fundementally different about the space version vs the earth version 
- find one key element that is different from the earth version that might change the intuition about the optimal solutions






4. property rights
- how do property rights (internationally public vs nationally public vs private) affect companies' or venture capitalists' willingness to invest in moon operations?
- theoretical model of property rights on the moon, with demand for seeing earth vs demand for sunshine vs demand for water

Stock market valuation changes from information shocks about property rights or other things that investors use as signals of future profitability
- using something about valuations






Antarcitca: hard to access.
How would you want property rights to evovlve? 
Could there be a transition from public property rights to private property rights -- when would that be?
Could think about parallels with colonization


==============================================================
      Identification
==============================================================
- look at the intro of good papers -- they will often have a part talking about identification, like DiD, natural experiment, randomization, etc


==============================================================
      Data partnerships
==============================================================
- startups (less support, and could lose interest over time, but past students have found success from being enrurpenurial)
- big established firms (harder to get for students, but typically more organized)

Questions to answer:
- how is the firm benefiting?
- how clear is the contract about publishing rights?
- how clear is the contract about commitment to data access?

How to reach out to a firm?
- cold emails can work, but try other methods if possible
- if you know someone thorugh your network, that works better
- do any of your faculty have connections? (probably most productive way)

Datasets that faculty have access to:
- all-payer claims datasets
- labor datasets

- data setup on campus
- experiments, surveys, webscraping, other?
- buying data - requires funding, and that you make sure ur going to use it effectively


==============================================================
      Conferences
==============================================================
- IO threory (Dec 2022, Columbia)
- NBER IO (stanford or boston)
- Coles conference at Yale (different applied theory conferences)
- Stanford SITEs Conferences (theroetical econometrics)
- IIOC (april, boston)
