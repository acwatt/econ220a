- Working on problem 2
- Look in both ps2.jl and ps2-notebook.jl. problem 2 work is beginning in ps2-notebook.jl

Problem 5 RCM
- Got all data/code for Nevo 2000 example RCM code. It ran after making some changes (open `rc_dc_acw.m` in Matlab).
- could either convert our data into the same matlab input as nevo or try to rewrite Nevo code in Julia...

LOOK AT KEN TRAINS PROBLEM SET AND CODE
- Logit, nested logit, mixed logit problem sets https://eml.berkeley.edu/~train/ec244ps.html
- Mixed logit software https://eml.berkeley.edu/~train/software.html

Also look at Yves Croissant's R package
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlogit/

and maybe John Helveston's R package
